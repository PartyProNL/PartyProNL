Hi there! I'm Youri, known as PartyProNL on the internet. I am currently a student at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, working on achieving my Bachelor's in Software Engineering.

I am primarily a Java/Kotlin back-end developer, but I am also experienced with developing websites. If you'd like to learn more about my work and skills, I recommend you visit my portfolio at https://partypronl.github.io/portfolio-site/
